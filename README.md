# Experimentation about poker in javascript

Goals are to explore (i) what a poker bot can do and (ii) how to assist a human player.

Ultimatly it would be entertaining and educational to write a poker bot able to win against humains.
It is a nice exercise to pursue.

Additionally a program can assist a human to take decision while they play. Computers got
massive computing power and thus can provide informations otherwise unavailable to 
humains. It provides the accuracy of the computer while leaving the decision to the human. 
It will be at least as good as the human playing.
